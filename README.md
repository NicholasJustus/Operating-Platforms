## Summary of Projects

### Project One: DriverPass (Business Requirements)
**Client**: DriverPass  
**Software Requirements**: The client required a web-based system for managing and hosting online driving courses, including user registration, scheduling, and progress tracking.

- **What I Did Well**: I effectively identified and documented the client's needs, ensuring a clear understanding of user and system requirements.
- **Revisions**: I would improve the user interface details by incorporating more visual mockups and diagrams.
- **Interpreting User Needs**: I prioritized clarity and precision when documenting requirements, ensuring they aligned with the clientâ€™s goals and user experience.

### Project Two: Draw It or Lose It (System Design)
**Client**: The Gaming Room  
**Software Requirements**: A scalable, web-based multiplayer gaming platform supporting cross-platform compatibility.

- **What I Did Well**: I successfully implemented design patterns like Singleton for game instance management and Iterator for validating unique names.
- **Revisions**: If I could improve one section, I would expand on the system architecture to include detailed UML diagrams.
- **Designing for Users**: Understanding user needs ensured that the game was accessible, secure, and functional across platforms, enhancing user engagement.

## My Design Process
To design software:
1. Analyze user requirements and constraints.
2. Use **design patterns** (Singleton, Iterator) to ensure maintainability.
3. Evaluate platforms (Linux for servers, Windows/Mac for clients).
4. Prioritize scalability and resource optimization for smooth performance.
